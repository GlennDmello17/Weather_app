## Weather Application
Overview
This is a weather application built with React that allows users to search for and display current weather information for various cities around the world. The application fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Features
-Search for weather information by city name.
-Display current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and more.
-Dynamic background images based on weather conditions.


What I Learned
While building this weather application, I gained valuable experience and improved my skills in the following areas:

1.React Development: Strengthened my understanding of React components, state management, and props. I also improved my ability to structure and organize a React application effectively.

2.API Integration: Learned how to fetch and handle data from external APIs using fetch and async/await. I also became more familiar with handling asynchronous operations and managing API keys securely using environment variables.

3.Environment Variables and Security: Gained knowledge on how to securely manage and use environment variables in a React application using dotenv. I also learned the importance of .gitignore to prevent sensitive information from being exposed in version control.
